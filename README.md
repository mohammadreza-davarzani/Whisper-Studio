A cross-platform desktop application for AI-powered audio and video transcription using [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). Built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Stack

- Electron for cross-platform desktop runtime
- React and Vite for the renderer workbench
- shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS for the renderer design system
- TypeScript project references for main, preload, renderer, and shared code
- Electron Builder for macOS, Windows, and Linux packaging
- ESLint and Prettier for contributor-friendly consistency

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Release Targets

Electron Builder is configured for:

- macOS: `dmg`, `zip`
- Windows: `nsis`, `portable`
- Linux: `AppImage`, `deb`

Code signing, notarization, update feeds, and platform-specific icons should be added before publishing production releases.

Tagged releases that match `v*` run `.github/workflows/release.yml` and upload platform artifacts from macOS, Windows, and Linux runners.
